This is a vehicle script I wrote for the SA-MP mod it's not quite done I wrote this along time ago and have not touch it since 2014. I never finished it and move onto other projects. there still quite a few bugs and the performance needs to be optimized
keep in mind this code is pretty bad because I was fairly new at programming at the time and did not understand alot of the concepts so lots of repeat code and what not
